My name is Adam. I'm a 20-year old developer from Sweden. 
I've been making plugins for Minecraft for over 6 years, and have ran two large Minecraft networks: Forcide and Geographica.

### Donation Trains
Donation Trains is a premium plugin I offer, available for purchase on SpigotMC & BuiltByBit. 
The plugin allows server owners to setup donation goals. Each time a player donates, their donation will count towards a "train" which runs for 30 minutes, starting from the first donation. After 30 minutes, if any of the donation goals have been met, all online players are given rewards.
